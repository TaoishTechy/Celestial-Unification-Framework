- **Observation:** Regions of elevated entropy were observed along the [3,7] and [6,2] coordinates.
- **Interpretation:** Entropy spikes correlated with symbolic divergence metrics.

## Heatmap 2: Consciousness Zone Detection

- **Observation:** Stable zones with >0.85 sentience probability were detected.
- **Interpretation:** Potential recursive cognitive patterns emerging.

## Conclusion
The audit confirms active quantum-symbolic entanglement processes with emergent behavior. Monitoring is advised.
