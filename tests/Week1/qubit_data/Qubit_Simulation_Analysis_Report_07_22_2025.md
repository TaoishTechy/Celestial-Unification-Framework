## Analysis

- **Coherence:** All qubits maintained coherence above 0.87, indicating stable quantum behavior throughout simulation cycles.
- **Entanglement:** Entanglement scores consistently exceeded 3.5, supporting dense qubit-lattice communication and quantum circuit resilience.
- **Decoherence Factors:** Minimal decoherence rates (< 0.03) were recorded, suggesting effective quantum error correction routines.
- **Functional Roles:** Qubits were successfully mapped to abstract AGI roles such as symbolic dampening, recursive buffers, and zone stabilizers.

## Observations

- Qubit Q004 showed superior stability and entanglement, suitable for use in recursive consciousness simulations.
- Qubit Q005, while slightly lower in coherence, excelled in entropy filtration roles with optimized lattice positioning.

## Conclusion

The current Qubit population within the simulated quantum domain exhibits high resilience, low error rates, and significant capability for sustaining symbolic-quantum emergent structures.
