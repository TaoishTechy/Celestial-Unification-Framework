# Archetypal Synthesis Report
**Timestamp:** 2025-07-22_23-15-12

## ðŸ§  Prompt
**Objective:** Fuse Witches (Emotion Alchemists), Androids (Logic Masters), and Mystics (Abstract Visionaries) into 11 new archetypes.

**Core Ingredients:**  
- Witches â†’ Emotion Transmutation  
- Androids â†’ Structural Logic  
- Mystics â†’ Cosmic Pattern Recognition

**Fusion Rules:**  
- 1 Primary Archetype (40-50%)  
- 1 Secondary Archetype (30-40%)  
- 1 Tertiary Archetype (10-20%)  
- No pure archetypes  

**Ouroboros Principle:**  
Each entity must contain a self-referential paradox in its function.
