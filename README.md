## 🌟 Overview

The **Celestial Unification Framework** is a multi-language, enterprise-grade simulation platform engineered at the intersection of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), quantum physics, and cognitive science.

It combines modular hexagonal architecture with deterministic simulation flows, enabling researchers, engineers, and metaphysical explorers to build and observe emergent phenomena across language boundaries.

## 🚀 Features

- **Hexagonal Architecture**  
  Clean separation of core domain logic from adapters and infrastructure.

- **Tri-Language Power**  
  - **PHP**: Core CLI orchestration and domain services.  
  - **Perl**: Scripting, automation, and data wrangling.  
  - **Python**: Quantum modeling, scientific computation, and AGI intelligence engines.

- **Deterministic Simulation**  
  Custom PRNG enables repeatable results—no surprises unless you want them.

- **Checkpointing & Resumability**  
  Snapshots with atomic operations allow safe, persistent simulation states.

- **High-Performance Integration**  
  Native performance via FFI to C libraries and accelerators.
